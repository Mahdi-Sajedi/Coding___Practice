The OK Web Server and the Tame C++ Event System were both built to solve specific problems at OkCupid, but became more general research projects. And it was an offhand remark by the chief of product at OkCupid -- "why can't we just open source this whole site?" -- that helped launch a multi-year, multi-institution investigation into information flow control for web sites at the operating system level.

In this talk, Max will discuss the history of OkCupid, his personal history as a CSAIL grad student, and how the two intertwined. He will cover OkCupid's scrappy and parsimonious approach to systems technology and some of the website's published social scientific results.

Bio: Max Krohn (PhD 2008) was the co-founder and CTO of TheSpark.com, SparkNotes.com and OkCupid.com. He currently lives in New York City, where he works on new startup opportunities.
