## Interesting [project](https://dat-tran.com/projects/) description

CRM.

I concepted and set up the data engineering flow with Apache Nifi to automate idealo's CRM workflow which resulted €1m in the 1st year, €2m in the 2nd year and €3m in the 3rd year
My team built a tree-based classifier to predict non-purchases of customers which helped idealo's CRM team to target those customers three days ahead before we receive the actual sales data by the shops
