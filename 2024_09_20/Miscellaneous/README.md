[Myth Machines](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107a/notes/myth-machines) at Stanford:

In CS 107, you won't run a single line of your code on your own laptop. Instead, you'll be using SSH to run all of your programs remotely on these Myth machines.

Do we have to? Yes. It's important to know how to use ssh and to use computers remotely through a terminal. Real programmers do this all the time, and especially so during the pandemic.
