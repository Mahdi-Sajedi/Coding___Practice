Good lecture, offers a good summary of the literature on RAG.

Hi, about Atlas. You said that we can update the Retriever. At 42:00 is some retriever loss, but what about pair label (question, positive paragraph, negative paragraphs) like normal retrieval model - do they contribute to the retriever loss ? I read codebase of Atlas, and do not find that kind of loss
